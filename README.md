# RTO-Cart
Redesigned T-Cart - Multicart for Mattel Intellivision based on Teensy 4.1
It work with bin file loaded on sdcard, with ram/rom mapping from .cfg files with same name in same folder.
If found the [macro] section in the .cfg files, it ask for using the Cheat's pokes (middle button) or ignore them (other button).
File navigation is done with by buttons, while playing button 1 resets the console, button 3 resets the Cart.

You probably don't need mounting the resistor near the edge for reset the console, try yourself and be sure to have a good bipolar cap at reset line in your console! ;)
