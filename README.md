# RTO-Cart
Redesigned T-Cart - Multicart for Mattel Intellivision based on Teensy 4.1
It work with bin file loaded on sdcard, with ram/rom mapping from .cfg files with same name in same folder.
File navigation is done with the two button ("next" and "select"). The ".." choose when in subfolder returns always to root.

WARNING! In the previous Kicad's project were listed 74LS245 ICs instead the right ones 74LVC245: be sure to use only 74LVC245, becouse Teensy 4.1 doesn't support 5V signals!!
